# SOC-Simulations

This repository contains my hands-on labs and simulations from **TryHackMe SOC Simulator**, with a primary focus on **Security Operations Center (SOC)** activities.  
It is designed to showcase **practical SOC experience** to recruiters and hiring managers.

All scenarios are completed using the **TryHackMe SOC Simulator**, covering real-world tasks such as alert triage, phishing investigation, and incident response across multiple SIEM platforms.  
Although examples may show one SIEM, all labs have been repeated using **Splunk, ELK, and Microsoft Sentinel**.

It covers topics including:

- Alert triage and investigation  
- Phishing analysis  
- Log correlation  
- Incident response  
- False positive validation  
- Threat detection

## 📌 Data Handling Notice

Some logs or screenshots may contain **masked or redacted fields** (e.g., missing session IDs or anonymized data).  
There may also be a lack of screenshots in some areas.
This is required as these labs are part of **TryHackMe’s business-exclusive training environments**.
