SOC-Simulations

This repository demonstrates my practical, hands-on experience in Security Operations Center (SOC) environments, created specifically to showcase real-world skills to recruiters and hiring managers.

All scenarios are based on native SOC simulations from TryHackMe, where I operate as a SOC analyst to triage alerts, investigate threats, and respond to incidents across multiple SIEM platforms.

The primary objective of this repository is not academic learning, but evidence of operational capability — how I analyze logs, make decisions, document findings, and respond to security events under realistic conditions.

Although screenshots or examples may show one specific SIEM in use, every scenario has been repeated and validated across multiple SIEM technologies, including Splunk, ELK, and Microsoft Sentinel.

🛡️ SOC Responsibilities Demonstrated

This repository reflects real SOC workflows, including:

Alert triage and prioritization

Phishing investigation and response

Log correlation and root cause analysis

Detection and investigative reasoning

Incident response workflows

Threat hunting fundamentals

False positive validation

Escalation and reporting

🔧 SIEMs & Technologies

Hands-on simulations are performed across multiple platforms to demonstrate tool-agnostic SOC competence:

SIEM Platforms:

Splunk

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Microsoft Sentinel

SOC Simulator Environment:

Native TryHackMe SOC Simulator

Simulated enterprise infrastructure

Realistic log sources (email, firewall, endpoints, web servers)

🧪 SOC Simulator (TryHackMe)

The SOC Simulator provides an environment where I:

Investigate alerts as a real SOC analyst

Analyze phishing emails, URLs, and attachments

Correlate logs across multiple data sources

Identify attacker techniques and behaviors

Decide on containment, remediation, or escalation actions

This directly demonstrates:

Analytical decision-making

Precision in alert handling

Time-sensitive investigation skills

Operational readiness for SOC roles

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to serve as a technical portfolio for SOC roles, showing:

How I approach security problems

How I document investigations

How I reason about attacker behavior

How I validate detections

How I communicate findings clearly

It is designed to answer the core recruiter question:

"Can this person actually function in a live SOC?"

📌 Data Handling & Masking Notice

Some logs, screenshots, or artifacts may contain masked or partially redacted fields (e.g., missing session IDs, truncated IPs, anonymized user data).

This is intentional and required, as the SOC Simulator is part of TryHackMe’s business-exclusive training environments, and certain data elements must remain protected.

🚀 Who This Repository Is For

This portfolio is intended for:

SOC hiring managers

Technical recruiters

Blue Team leads

Security engineering teams

Anyone reviewing this repository should expect real investigative workflows, not sanitized academic exercises.

⚠️ Disclaimer

All content is generated from controlled, simulated SOC environments.
No real production systems or sensitive organizational data are involved.

This repository represents my transition from learning security to operating as a security professional, with a strong emphasis on practical, job-ready SOC skills.

GOOD but I want it like this pls in md file # TryHackMe Writeups

This repository contains my hands-on labs, experiments, and projects from **TryHackMe**, with a primary focus on **Defensive Security (Blue Team)**.  
While most writeups here are defensive in nature, I have also completed **Offensive Security (Red Team)** labs on TryHackMe — those are not yet documented in this repository and will be slowly added in the future.

It covers a broad range of topics, including:

- Cyber Defense Frameworks  
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)  
- Network Security & Traffic Analysis  
- Endpoint Security  
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)  
- Phishing Analysis  
- Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
During these labs, I have gained practical experience using a variety of tools:

- **Endpoint Security:** EDR concepts, Windows & Linux hardening  
- **SIEM & Log Analysis:** Splunk, ELK Stack  
- **Network Security:** Wireshark, firewalls, traffic analysis  
- **Threat Intelligence & CTI:** Open-source threat intel feeds, MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- **Forensics & Incident Response:** Autopsy, Volatility, FTK Imager  
- **Phishing & CTF Labs:** Simulated phishing analysis, attack/defense exercises  

---

## 📚 Learning Platforms
The hands-on experience in this repository is primarily based on **TryHackMe labs**, supported by:

- Utilized TryHackMe's AttackBox and VMs as home labs
- Realistic network and endpoint simulations  
- Independent CTF challenges to reinforce concepts  

This approach ensures that my learning is **both structured and self-driven**, with an emphasis on practical, real-world security skills.

Here is your SOC-Simulations README.md, written in the same structure and tone as your original, but optimized for recruiters and SOC roles:
